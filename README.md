CSS Flexbox Project

For this project I was asked to re-create a landing page using html and css from a supplied image and stylesheet. 

I found the project very straightforward and relatively simple after finishing the earlier flexbox lessons and assignments. 

Overall, the assignment left me feeling confident with my css skills.
